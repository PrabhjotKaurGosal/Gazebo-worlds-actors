# Gazebo-worlds-actors
This reporsitory contains Gazebo worlds. Most of the models used came with Gazebo when it was installed.
These worlds have been tested on Gazebo-9

# Short Description of various worlds
Cafe_actors.world : I used cafe.world file from Gazebo as a starting point and modified it by adding actors and other objects. The actors were later spawned with their trajectories as defined in the world file.
